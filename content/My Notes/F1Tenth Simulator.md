>[!Note]
> Fast Prototyping, Motion Planing, Racing Algorithm Test

- More portable
- Faster setup
- Faster prototyping
- Safer driving
- Sim to Real

## [Side Project](https://github.com/thejourneyofbabo/f1sim_ws)
I updated some of Docker file and added the package for Rust-ROS2 setup
so inside the sim_ws/src folder, you might also could see rust_ws package which include some code to interact with simulation environment
