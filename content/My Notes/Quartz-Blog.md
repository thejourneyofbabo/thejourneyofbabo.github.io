# My Second Brain

I was trying to connect my thoughts, ideas, and knowledge. Since I'm using Obsidian, I can connect my notes like nodes. I'm still getting used to this system but will continue to try more. As I'm not a native English speaker, there might be some mistakes. And I believe it's all part of the learning process.

## How did I build it?
I followed the instructions from [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) from the beginning. I also watched a YouTube video [How to publish your notes for free with Quartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s6DT1yN4dw&t=34s). I first learned about Quartz from [Steven Gong's Blog](https://stevengong.co/).

### Modifying the style
- [[Index Page Component Behavior]] This explains how to manage which components are shown on specific pages
- [[Quartz Update Graph View Setting]] I configured this for the first [[content/index|index]] page, showing a Global graph view while other pages show a Local graph view
